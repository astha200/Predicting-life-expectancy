# Predicting-life-expectancy

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.

Dataset used for predicting is taken from kaggle and the description of the various columns of the dataset is as follows:
1. Country- Country
2. Year- Year
3. Status- Developed or Developing status
4. Life Expectancy- Age(years)
5. Adult Mortality- Adult Mortality Rates of both sexes(probability of dying between 15&60 years per 1000 population)
6. Infant Deaths- Number of Infant Deaths per 1000 population
7. Alcohol- Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)
8. Percent Expenditure- Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%)
